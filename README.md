Lexical Comparison Between News Mediums by Using Word Embeddings for Media Bias Identification

### Abstract
In the term paper, lexical comparison between left- and right-wing news mediums (The Huffington Post and Breitbart News) is conducted with the focus on bias inducing lexica and with the use of word embeddings. No direct relation is found between bias inducing words and the words whose vectors are distant from each other in the word embedding spaces trained separately on the HuffPost and Breitbart articles. Among the most similar words (in the word embedding spaces) to the words related to controversial opinions between left- and right-wing communities, no salient differences were found. The differences in the most similar words to bias inducing words cannot be explained by the differences in the views of left- and right-leaning communities.
